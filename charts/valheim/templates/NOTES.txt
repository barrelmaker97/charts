Valheim has been installed!

To get the password for the server, run:

    kubectl get secret --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ include "valheim.fullname" . }}-password -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 --decode

If you did not set a password manually, then one was generated for you.
The auto-generated password will be rotated when this helm chart is upgraded.
Please set a password if you would like to avoid password rotation on upgrade.
